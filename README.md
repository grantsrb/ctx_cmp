# Leveraging Large Language Models for Context Compression
This repo was created as a class project for [CS 324 - Advances in Foundation Models in Winter 2023](https://stanford-cs324.github.io/winter2023/). See the [accompanying pdf](https://github.com/grantsrb/ctx_cmp/blob/master/Grant-March2023-LeveragingLLMsForContextCompression.pdf) for a writeup of the project.

Another paper called [Adapting Language Models for Context Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14788) came out shortly after the class was finished doing almost exactly the same technique.
